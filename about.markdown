Hi, I am Siddhant. Currently I work as a Software Developer at [Juspay](https://juspay.in/), where I build UI frameworks in `Purescript` and `JavaScript` along with a touch of `Haskell` to build APIs. Previosuly, I worked with [DBS Bank](https://www.dbs.com/), where I primarily built a OAuth Implementation in `Java`. 

This is a personal blog, where I'll be posting posts about software development, movie reviews, random observations etc.
