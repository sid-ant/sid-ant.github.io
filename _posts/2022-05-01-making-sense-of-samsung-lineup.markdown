Samsung manufactures and sells a lof of smartphones. However, it's really hard to understand if a smartphone is good enough or current just by knowing it's name. 
Contradictory to this is Apple, where common sense dictates that an iPhone 13 is better than an iPhone 12. 
Which may not be entirely true but consistent naming is extemely important to build a brand. 

Samsung doesn't have a brand as strong as Apple, and I can only speculate that it's a conscious decision by Samsung to have a confusing lineup. 

## S and Z Series

Fairly straightforward and most understood. These smartphones are not value for money and they represent the best Samsung has to offer. 

| Series      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Z           | Foldables   |
| S           | Flagships   |

## A series

A series is available on most markets. S series represents the current year as S22 can be read as S 2022. 
A Series may represent current year + 1. Numbers ending with `3` are the latest smartphones for the current year `2` (2022). 

I don't understand why would Samsung do this. Keeping their naming similar to their Flagships would've helped create a better brand. 

| A Series      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A73         | Premium Mid-Range   |
| A53         | The best value   |
| A33         | Comprises on screen   |
| A23         | Comprises on performance   |
| A13         | Bare minimum   |

Here's a comparison link for the above smartphones:

## M Series

M series is available on a fewer markets and they represent the true value Samsung has to offer. 
They provide a complete smartphone experiance and they are afforable enough to be upgraded every other year or replaced when one breaks. 

| M Series      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| M53         | The best value   |
| M33         | decent value |
| M23         | Similar to M33  |
| M13         | Not yet launched |

Here's a comparison link for the above smartphones:

2022 : [M73 vs M53 vs M33](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=11439&idPhone2=11404&idPhone3=11403)
2021 : [M72 vs M52 vs M32](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=11110&idPhone2=11062&idPhone3=11011)

## Conclusion 

Samsung releases at-least 9/10 smartphones in the mid-range segment alone, every year. And they don't always stop selling previous generation smartphones. For example M52 is still available for purchase and in many ways it is a better phone than the newer M53. However it's too hard for a general consumer to know which is a better phone. Also there are exceptions to the above lineup, sometimes they would release phones as [A52s,A42,M42](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=11110&idPhone2=11062&idPhone3=11011) but there is no M41 or A51s or A53s etc. 

In conlusion with these many smartphone, there is no way to build a word of mouth for the brand. The competition is too fierce for such a confusing lineup. 

However, If I were Samsung, I would release 1 phone in each of the following series. 

### Dream Lineup 

| Phone      | Description | Cost        |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| S22           | Flagships   | $700+       |
| A22           | Premium Midrange   | $500+       |
| M22           | Value for Money   | $300+       |
| N22           | Affordables   | $200+       |
| G22           | Enablers   | $100+       |
