I first heard of the `corrupting the minds` phrase in a PewDiePie video where he was discussing Plato and Socrates. Especially when he tells us that Socrates was sentenced to death for corrupting the minds of youth. Ofcourse, when I first heard it, I paid no attention to it and continued with the 20+ minute video. 

I work as a Software Developer and as most developers know, communication is more important than writing code and solving problems. Over the years to be able to communicate better, I've started asking the `intent` of a conversation and observing deltas in speech over time. This obviously extended past the office hours, and slipped even into my relationships. To able to quanitfy one's interest, first impressions and to look at yourself through the eyes of countless others, felt powerfull and at times, sad. 

In the last few months, this further evolved into asking `why` a person behaves the way do? the words they say? the thoughts they think?. 

Today, we consume content at a pace which was unfathomable to the majority of humans who ever lived. We watch countless YT videos, movies, anime, scroll through endless feed of twitter, instagram, currated search and ad results. Could they be the Socrates of the 21st Century? 

I've noticed people forming heavy opinions on topics they otherwise would not have encountered, had it not been for a harmless meme. 

It starts small, a person reads a tweet, they pay no attention to it, and then after a week or so, something else comes up and they are reminded of the tweet they read. Soon, they now know something but it hasn't changed anything. Maybe after many moons, they encounter another idea, and  are reminded of a past idea. The past idea whose's orgin they can't trace but it's there. And so the knowledge graph keeps extending, they start forming strong enough ideas which could now translate into actions. 

But are the actions, truely theirs or are they engineered? 

From reading the tweet to the physical action, the person never tried to debate against the idea, as they would've, had the idea came from someone they could argue with. You can't argue with a meme. 

Now this begs the question, are our thoughts ours? How many of my your thoughts are truely original but not an extension of a pre-existing knowledge node? In this way, do humans, dead or alive, influence each other and sort of make a super knowledge graph? 

From, `you are who you surround yourself with`, it is now `you are who you are subscribed to` and quite literally. 

Had I not viewed the video, would I have written this post?
